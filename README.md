# Sign-In with Ethereum for Discourse

A Discourse plugin that lets users authenticate with their Ethereum wallet using
the [Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE)](https://login.xyz) standard. Injected wallets
(MetaMask, Safe, etc.) work out of the box. ENS names and avatars are resolved
server-side when an RPC endpoint is configured.

## Requirements

- A Discourse forum that is self-hosted or hosted with a provider that supports
  third-party plugins, like [Communiteq](https://www.communiteq.com/).

## Installation

Access your container's `app.yml` file:

```bash
cd /var/discourse
nano containers/app.yml
```

Add a `before_code` hook to install `rubyzip` and an `after_code` hook to
clone the plugin:

```yml
hooks:
  before_code:
    - exec:
        cmd:
          - gem install rubyzip
  after_code:
    - exec:
      cd: $home/plugins
      cmd:
        - sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/discourse/docker_manager.git
        - sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/FritzDVL/discourse-siwe-auth.git # <-- added
```

### Why both hooks are needed

**`before_code` → `gem install rubyzip`**: the `rbsecp256k1` native crypto gem
this plugin depends on uses `rubyzip` inside its own `extconf.rb` to fetch and
unpack the libsecp256k1 C source during build. That happens at `bundle install`
time, *before* Discourse processes the `gem` directives in `plugin.rb`, so the
plugin's own gem block can't supply it in time. Installing `rubyzip`
system-wide in `before_code` guarantees it's on disk when the native
extension's build script runs.

**`after_code` → `sudo -E -u discourse git clone`**: always run the clone as
the unprivileged `discourse` user. On Ubuntu 24.04 a plain `git clone` runs as
`root` inside the container and produces files the Rails build cannot read,
which surfaces as a confusing failure during `./launcher rebuild app`. The
`-E` flag preserves the environment; `-u discourse` runs the command as the
user the rest of the Discourse build expects to own the plugin tree. Match the
exact form of the existing `docker_manager.git` line in your `app.yml`; if
that line is missing the prefix, your container is using an older layout —
add the prefix to both lines rather than dropping it from the new one.

Rebuild the container:

```bash
cd /var/discourse
./launcher rebuild app
```

## Configuration

After installation, find the plugin under **Admin > Plugins** and make sure it
is enabled:

![Installed plugins](/installed-plugins.png 'Installed plugins')

Click **Settings** to configure the plugin:

![Plugin settings](/settings.png 'Plugin settings')

From here you can customize the sign-in statement and optionally add a
WalletConnect / Reown project ID. Without a project ID, only injected wallets
(MetaMask, Safe, etc.) are available.

### Settings

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Discourse siwe enabled** | Enable or disable Sign-In with Ethereum authentication. |
| **Siwe ethereum rpc url** | _Optional._ An Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoint used for ENS name/avatar resolution and EIP-1271 signature verification (required for smart contract wallets like SAFE). A dedicated provider (Alchemy, Infura) is recommended. Example: `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY`. |
| **Siwe project ID** | _Optional._ A WalletConnect / Reown project ID. Without it, only injected wallets (MetaMask, Safe, etc.) are available. To enable WalletConnect, create a free project ID at [dashboard.reown.com](https://dashboard.reown.com). |
| **Siwe statement** | The human-readable statement shown in the SIWE message. Defaults to "Sign in with Ethereum". |

## Tests

The plugin includes unit and integration tests for ENS resolution helpers and
EIP-6492 smart wallet signature verification.

### Unit tests (no network needed)

```bash
ruby test/ens_unit_test.rb
ruby test/smart_wallet_unit_test.rb
```

### Integration tests (require an Ethereum RPC endpoint)

```bash
ruby test/ens_integration_test.rb
ruby test/smart_wallet_integration_test.rb
```

By default, integration tests use a public RPC. Set `RPC_URL` for a dedicated
provider:

```bash
RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY ruby test/smart_wallet_integration_test.rb
```

### Run all tests

```bash
for f in test/*_test.rb; do ruby "$f"; done
```

## How it works

When a user clicks the Ethereum login button, the plugin opens a dedicated
authentication. The user connects their wallet, signs a SIWE message,
and is authenticated via an OmniAuth strategy on the server side.

After first sign-in, users are asked to associate an email address with their
account. If an RPC URL is configured and the connected address has an ENS name,
the name is resolved and verified server-side and suggested as the default
username. ENS avatars are fetched via the ENS metadata service and used as the
profile photo.

Alternatively, existing users can connect their Ethereum accounts via
their profile settings.
